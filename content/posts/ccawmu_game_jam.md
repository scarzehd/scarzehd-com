I've finally managed to get a full game out!

It wasn't easy. I submitted my final build 8 minutes before the deadline. However, I'm actually pretty happy with this game. I'm hoping that this will kickstart several new small games to get ready for The Big One. We'll see how all that goes, but, in the meantime, I'd like to review what I think went well and what didn't.

# The Good

First of all, the game jam in question was hosted by my university. It took place over the course of 1 week, which just so happened to be the same week as both Halloween and my birthday. It was a rush, but I think the deadline forced me to actually get it done. I have way too many half-finished prototypes that I'll probably never pick up again.

I'm happy with my progress as an artist. I've always had the coding skills, but art is something I've always struggled with. I strayed a bit from my usual Undertale-inspired style (thanks Temmie!) because of the sidescrolling perpsective and the time constraint. Most of the art is very simple, but I think it looks good.

Here's an example of my usual style.

Rune isn't the main character of this game, though. This is Charlie:

It's a lot more simplistic, but I think it works well. I'm especially proud of this mirror sprite:

I think this looks especially good with Charlie's reflection (?) in it.

# The Bad

As happy as I am with this game, there were some problems. First of all, there's not that many levels. There's only 9, which isn't even really enough to show off all the ways the mechanics can interact with each other. I made some bounce pads that only ever got used once. Beyond that, it seems that the different abilites were unintuitive. I didn't have time for a proper tutorial, so I had to just slap some text on the title screen with the controls.

Another thing that proved to be more of an issue than I predicted were some of the colors. They were too close together on some monitors, and the only differentiation between what ability Charlie is using is the color of his hoodie. The Red and Orange abilities were easy to get confused. The Red ability was especially problematic because its mechanic of destorying objects is only used twice near the end and most people didn't even pick up on what it did. The Gray hoodie was also a problem; it lets you double jump, but some people who played the game had trouble clearing some jumps even with that ability.

# The Conclusion

I'm considering going back and fixing some of the issues I had with the game. It is intended to be a character introduction for Charlie, but I don't know if it serves that purpose very well. If I do revisit it, I'll add some new levels and maybe a better ending. I'll release a devlog on itch.io and a post here if and when it's done.

All that said, if you'd like to try the game for yourself, it can be found [here](https://scarzehd.itch.io/charlie-and-the-mirror-monster) for free. You can play it in your browser, but there is also a downloadable version. For any of you other game devs out there who want to see my spaghetti code, you can easily decompile it (just as long as you don't share the source code) using [gdsdecomp.](https://github.com/bruvzg/gdsdecomp)

I wish you all luck in your endeavors. Until next time!
