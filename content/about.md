# Hey There!

I make wacky stuff for no reason.
Except sometimes I don't.

# Who are you?

I'm a student of Cyber Security. I like making games and fiddling with my homelab.

# What's this site for?

I post here about my various projects that I occasionally feel like working on. If you're interested in that, check back here every so often. I post progress on games here, plus the occasional bad pixel art.

# Is that it?

Yeah, pretty much. Stick around if you want. Or don't.
